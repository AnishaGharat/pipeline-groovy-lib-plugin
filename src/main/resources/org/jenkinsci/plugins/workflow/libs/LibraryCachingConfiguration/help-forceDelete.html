    To avoid that clearing the cache interferes with running builds this process is normally guarded by locks.
    Pressing the <i>Clear Cache</i> button will wait for a maximum of 10 seconds to get a lock.<br/>
    By checking this option, the library will be deleted immediately without acquiring a lock. This can lead to build errors 
    if a build is copying the library from the cache while it gets delete. This risk is all the greater, the larger the library is.
