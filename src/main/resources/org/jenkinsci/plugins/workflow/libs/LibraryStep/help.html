    <p>
        Load a library dynamically rather than using <code>@Library</code> syntax.
        You may use global variables defined in the library thereafter:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
library 'mylib@master'
usefulFunction()
</code></pre>
    <p>
        You may also load classes defined in the library by selecting their fully-qualified names
        like properties on the return value of this step, then call static methods
        or call constructors as if they were a method named <code>new</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def utils = library('mylib').com.mycorp.jenkins.Utils.new(this)
utils.handyStuff()
</code></pre>
</div>
