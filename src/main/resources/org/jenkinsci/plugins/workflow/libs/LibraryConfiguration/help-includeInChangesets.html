  <p>If checked, any changes in the library will be included in the changesets of a build.
  <p>This can be overridden in the jenkinsfile: name@version@changesets or name@version@nochangesets
  <p>The argument can also be yes/no/true/false for the override.
  <p>Just the changesets can be overridden by setting the version to null: mylibrary@null@changesets
